# This is a regular comment.
## This is a documentation comment.
print "Hello world!" # This is a regular comment on the same line as a statement.

{
	# Comment inside of "block" (meant as a regression test).
	# In practice, since comments are Tree-sitter extras, this is parsed as an empty map cuz there aren't any statements inside.
